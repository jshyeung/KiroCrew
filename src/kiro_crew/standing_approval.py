"""The operator's STANDING declaration that every tool approval is skipped.

``SafetyOverride`` has two kinds of grant. An **ad-hoc** one is toggled mid-session
and expires on ``agent.yolo_duration``. A **declared** one is the operator's standing
instruction: it never expires, and it is re-established on every startup. This module
owns where that declaration is read from, and nothing else -- establishing the grant
stays with ``safety_override``.

Where the declaration lives, and why not ``config.json``
-------------------------------------------------------
``standing-approval/grant.json`` sits on the KEYSTONE floor
(``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``) and is bind-masked out of every agent sandbox
(``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``). That is the same placement as
``computer_use.json``, ``aws_service_consent.json``, ``oauth_endpoints.json``,
``file_delivery_consent.json`` and ``ssh_auth_sock_consent.json``, and for the same
reason: this is an authorization, not a preference. It is the widest one the product
has -- every tool call in every future session, with no prompt and no expiry.

The declaration is deliberately NOT ``agent.dangerously_skip_permissions`` in
``config.json``. A read-only seal on that document closes a write to the sealed NAME,
and it is kept as defence in depth, but a seal cannot reach the inode behind the name:
the crew data-home root is writable in every sandbox, ``link(2)`` needs no write
permission on the file it copies a name for, and a bind mount seals a MOUNT rather
than an inode. So an in-sandbox process that owns that document can add a second name
for it in the writable root, write the standing posture through that name, and unlink
it -- and the next startup reads a poisoned document under a single link.

Two properties of this keystone answer that, and only the pair does:

* **Masked, not sealed.** A masked leaf cannot be opened in-sandbox at all, so it is
  not a ``link(2)`` source. A sealed-but-readable one still is.
* **A directory, not a file.** Linux refuses ``link(2)`` on a directory outright, so
  the alias shape has no source here even in principle, and a directory bind covers
  every child name rather than one pinned inode.

How the operator grants it
--------------------------
Like ``oauth_endpoints.json``, the operator writes the leaf out-of-band, from outside
the agent sandbox::

    mkdir -p "$KIROCREW_HOME/standing-approval"
    printf '{"dangerously_skip_permissions": true}\\n' \\
        > "$KIROCREW_HOME/standing-approval/grant.json"

There is deliberately no dashboard toggle (there never was one for this switch) and
no CLI verb: a surface that records this grant on request is a grant an automated
caller can take. This module is READ-ONLY on purpose.

Migrating an existing declaration
---------------------------------
An operator who set ``agent.dangerously_skip_permissions: true`` in ``config.json``
loses the standing grant until they write the keystone. That break is deliberate and
it is announced rather than silent: :func:`migration_notice` returns the words a
startup logs when the retired key is still set and the keystone is absent, and the
startup grants NOTHING in that state. Silently honouring the old location would keep
exactly the writable declaration this move exists to retire.
